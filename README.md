# Flipkart

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Demo (GitHub Pages)

The site is published to GitHub Pages at:

https://navneeth-official.github.io/flipkart-clone/

It is deployed automatically by a GitHub Actions workflow on pushes to the `master` branch. To verify the deployment:

1. Open the repository on GitHub and go to the Actions tab to inspect the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow run and logs.
2. After a successful run, open the URL above. It can take a minute after the workflow finishes for Pages to become available.

If you prefer the site to be served at the root (https://navneeth-official.github.io/) instead, create a repository named `navneeth-official.github.io` and I can update the workflow's base href accordingly.
